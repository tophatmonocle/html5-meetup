html5-meetup
============

This repo is the demo code to get started at the Top Hat Monocle HTML5 meetup on Aug 1st 2012.

Agenda:
-------

For those of you that are just here to eat pizza and hang out there's no agenda. Just enjoy youselves!

If you're interested in learning some websockets goodness then read on.

We will hold tutorials in our board room, which has room for 10-15 people. The tutorials should be about 30minutes and will take you from setting up a simple node.js server to building a simple client side web app that uses websockets magic. There will be 2-3 tutorials depending on demand (each one will cover the same stuff.)

After the tutorial there will be 4 hours to code a websockets enabled game. Feel free to work in teams. Try to build something fun that others will be able to play.

Finally, at 12pm we will do quick 5 minute demos for all those who got something done. At which point there will be judging based on completely arbitrary criteria. Prizes will be given out.
